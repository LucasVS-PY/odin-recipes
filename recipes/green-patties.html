        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>The nature's larder is bursting and the wild plans - the weeds - stand knee high. You can actually eat your weeds. It's good for you - and your wallet.
            Here's a recipe for some tasty vegetarian patties full of vitamins.</p>

            <li>1 basket full of different fresh herbs</li>
            <li>2 chopped onions</li>
            <li>3 chopped cloves of garlic</li>
            <li>2 eggs</li>
            <li>1.5 cups oatmeal</li>
            <li>A little milk</li>
            <li>Salt</li>
            <li>Butter for frying</li>
        </ul> 

        <h2>Steps</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Wash and drain the weeds and chop them finely. Mix them with onion, oatmeal, milk, eggs and season with salt. The consistency must be quite firm.</li>
            <li>Scoop a spoonful of the mixture and shape into a ball using the palm of your hand.</li>
            <li>Melt the butter in a frying pan and cook the patties until golden brown on both sides.</li>
