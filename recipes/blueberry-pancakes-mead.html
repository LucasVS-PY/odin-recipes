        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>The wonderful summer berries will soon be ripe to pick and then why not have them with these delicious pancakes.
            Add mead to the batter for sweetness, but be careful as the honey in the mead will caramelize on the hot pan. Everyone else 
            but the Vikings might choose to sweeten the batter with modern sugar instead.
