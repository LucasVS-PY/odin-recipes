        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>It's really no hard work to make sausages from scratch... like the Vikings did. 
            These sausages are packed with good herbs and mustard seeds that pop between your teeth and add a flavoursome kick. 
            Choose a ground pork that is not too lean as it will result in dry sausages.</p>
        
        <h2>Ingredients</h2>
        <em>For about 10 sausages</em>
        <ul>
            <li>1-2 garlic cloves, finely chopped</li>
            <li>1-2 handfuls fresh herbs like thyme, sage and marjoram, finely chopped</li>
            <li>2 tablespoons thyme, dried</li>
            <li>1-2 tablespoons salt</li>
            <li>2-3 tablespoons mustard seeds</li>
            <li>400 g ground pork</li>
            <li>1/2 cup dark beer (100ml)</li>
            <li>1-2 pork casings</li>
            <li>Butter for frying</li>
            <li>1-2 tablespoons honey</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Steps</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Combine the ground pork with garlic, herbs, salt, mustard seeds and beer. Use your hands and make sure it is well mixed.</li>
            <li>Stuff the pork into the casings. Make a knot between each sausage.</li>
            <li>Place a pot of water over the fire. Add the sausages when the water is lukewarm and slowly let it come to a simmer. 
                Let the sausages cook (simmer) for about 15 minutes.</li>
            <li>Grill the sausages on your garden grill or pan fry the sausages in butter and honey. Melt some butter on a hot pan and add 1-2 tablespoons of
                honey.
            </li>
            <li>Cook the sausages for about 5 minutes on each side until golden and glazed.</li>
            <li>Serve the sausages with homemade mustard and a nice flatbread.</li>
        </ol>
